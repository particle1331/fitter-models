    "Distributed computing is becoming increasingly relevant for modern machine learning systems. OpenAI's recent paper AI and Compute suggests that the amount of compute needed to train AI models has roughly doubled every 3.5 months since 2012. Meanwhile, Moore's law has only seen increase in CPU petaflops 2x every 18 months. However, distributed systems are hard to program. Scaling a Python application to a cluster introduces challenges in communication, scheduling, security, failure handling, heterogeneity, transparency, and much more.\n",
