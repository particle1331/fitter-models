    "In this notebook, we look at the **backpropagation algorithm** (BP) for efficient gradient computation on computational graphs. Backpropagation involves local message passing of values in the forward pass, and gradients in the backward pass. Neural networks are computational graphs with nodes for differentiable operations. The time complexity of BP is linear in the size of the network, i.e. the total number of edges and compute nodes. This fact allows scaling training large neural networks. We will implement a minimal scalar-valued **autograd engine** and a neural network library[^1] on top it to train a small regression model.\n",

    "* **Runtime.** Each edge in the DAG is passed exactly once ({numref}`03-parent-child-nodes`). Hence, the time complexity for finding global gradients is $O(\\mathsf{E} + \\mathsf{V})$ where $\\mathsf{E}$ is the number of edges in the graph and $\\mathsf{V}$ is the number of vertices. Moreover, we assume that each compute node and local gradient evaluation is $O(1)$. It follows that computing $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}\\,\\mathcal{L}$ for an instance $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{x}}, y)$ is proportional to the network size, i.e. the same complexity as computing $f(\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{x}})$. Note that topological sorting of the nodes require the same time complexity."

This can leverage massive parallelism in the GPU significantly decreasing runtime by trading off memory.
